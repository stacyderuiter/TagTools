Title: Tools for Working with Data from High-Resolution Biologging Tags
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Stacy", "DeRuiter", email = "sld33@calvin.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: High-resolution movement-sensor tags typically include accelerometers 
    to measure body posture and sudden movements or changes in speed, 
    magnetometers to measure direction of travel, and pressure sensors
    to measure dive depth in aquatic or marine animals. 
    A subset of tags include sensors for speed, turning rate (gyroscopes), and sound. 
    This package provides software tools to facilitate calibration, processing, and analysis
    of such data. Tools are provided for:
    -Data Import/export,
    -Calibration (from raw data to calibrated data in scientific units),
    -Visualization (e.g., time-series plots, multiple events overlaid, long-term spectral averages),
    -Data Processing (e.g., event detection, derived metrics like jerk and dynamic acceleration, 
    dive detection and dive parameter calculation, integrating movement data with other sensors 
    eg acoustic or camera, integrating position data from onboard GPS, visual observations, etc. 
    with movement data), and
    -Statistical Analysis (e.g., track reconstruction, Mahalanobis distance analysis, state-switching models).
