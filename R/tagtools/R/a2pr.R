#' Pitch and roll from acceleration
#'
#' Pitch and roll estimation from triaxial accelerometer data. This is a non-iterative estimator with |pitch| constrained to <= 90 degrees. The pitch and roll estimates give the least-square-norm error between A and the A-vector that would be measured at the estimated pitch and roll. If A is in the animal frame, the resulting pitch and roll define the orientation of the animal with respect to its navigation frame. If A is in the tag frame, the pitch and roll will define the tag orientation with respect to its navigation frame.
#'
#' @param A An nx3 acceleration matrix with columns [ax ay az] or acceleration sensor list (e.g., from readtag.R). Acceleration can be in any consistent unit, e.g., g or m/s^2.
#' @param sampling_rate (optional) The sampling rate of the sensor data in Hz (samples per second). This is only needed if filtering is required. If A is a sensor data list, sampling_rate is obtained from its metadata (A$sampling_rate).
#' @param fc (optional) The cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter to apply to A before computing pitch and roll. The filter cut-off frequency is in Hertz. The filter length is 4*sampling_rate/fc. Filtering adds no group delay. If fc is not specified, no filtering is performed.

#' @return A list with 2 elements:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\strong{p: }} The pitch estimate in radians
#'  \item{\strong{r: }} The roll estimate in radians
#' }
#' @note Output sampling rate is the same as the input sampling rate.
#' @note Frame: This function assumes a [north,east,up] navigation frame and a [forward,right,up] local frame. In these frames, a positive pitch angle is an anti-clockwise rotation around the y-axis. A positive roll angle is a clockwise rotation around the x-axis. A descending animal will have a negative pitch angle while an animal rolled with its right side up will have a positive roll angle.
