#' Deduce the calibration constants
#'
#' This function is used to deduce the calibration constants for a triaxial field sensor, such as an accelerometer or magnetometer, based on movement data. This can be used to do a 'bench' calibration of a sensor.
#'
#' The function reports the residual and the axial balance of the data.
#' A low residual e.g., <5\% indicates that the data can be calibrated
#' well and there is not much noise.
#' The axial balance indicates whether the movement in X is
#' suitable for data-driven calibration. If the movement covers all
#' directions fairly equally, the axial balance will be high.
#' A balance <20 \% may lead to unreliable calibration.
#' For bench calibrations, a high axial balance is achieved by
#' rotating the sensor through the full 3-dimensions.
#' Sampling rate and frame of Y are the same as the input data so
#' Y has the same size as X. The units of Y are the same as the units
#' used for n. If n is not specified, the units of Y are the same as
#' for the input data. It is a good idea to low-pass filter and/or
#' remove outliers from the sensor data before using this function
#' to reduce errors from specific acceleration and sensor noise.
#' @param X The segment of triaxial sensor data to calibrate. It must be a 3-column matrix. X can come from any triaxial field sensor and can be in any unit and any frame.
#' @param n The target field magnitude e.g., 9.81 for accelerometer data using m/s^2 as the unit.
#' @param method An optional string selecting the type of calibration. The default is to calibrate for offset and scaling only. Other options are: 'gain' adjust gain of axes 2 and 3 relative to 1, or 'cross' adjust gain and remove cross-axis correlations
#' @return A list with 2 elements:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\strong{Y: }} The matrix of converted sensor values. These will have the same units as for input argument n. The size of Y is the same as the size of X and it has the same frame and sampling rate.
#'  \item{\strong{G: }} The calibration structure containing fields: G.poly is a matrix of polynomials. The first column of G.poly is the three scale factors applied to the columns of X. The second column is the offset added to each column of X after scaling. G.cross is a 3x3 matrix of cross-factors. If there are no cross-terms, this is the identity matrix. Off-axis terms correct for cross-axis sensitivity.
#' }
#' A message will also be printed to the screen presenting
#' @note This function uses a Simplex search for optimal calibration parameters and so can be slow if the data size is large.
#' For this reason it is most suitable for bench calibrations rather than
#' field data. This function is only usable for field sensors.
#' It will not work for gyroscope data.
