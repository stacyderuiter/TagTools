#' Buffers a signal vector into matrix
#'
#' This function is used to buffer a signal vector into a matrix of data frames. If the input for nodelay is TRUE, the the signal is buffered with no delay. If nodelay is FALSE, and specifies a vector of samples to precede x[1] in an overlapping buffer.
#' @param x The signal vector to be buffered
#' @param n The desired length of data segments (rows).
#' @param overlap The desired amount of overlap between consecutive frames (columns) in the output matrix
#' @param opt The vector of samples specified to precede x[1] in an overlapping buffer
#' @param nodelay A logical statement to determine if the vector should be buffered with or without delay. Default is FALSE (with delay)
#' @return A list with 3 elements is returned if nodelay = FALSE:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\strong{X: }} A matrix of the buffered signal vector "vec" with "n" data segments and an overlap between consecutive frames specified by "p". The matrix starts with "opt" values if nodelay is FALSE.
#' \item{\strong{z: }}  The remainder of the vector which was not included in the matrix if the last column did not have a full number of rows.
#' \item{\strong{opt: }} The last values, length of "p", of the matrix "X".
#' }
#' @return If no delay = TRUE, then a matrix of the buffered signal vector "vec" with "n" data segments and an overlap between consecutive frames specified by "overlap". The matrix starts with "opt" values if nodelay is FALSE.
