#' Add colored line segments to a plot
#'
#' This function adds colored line segments to an existing plot.  The line is plotted at points specified by inputs x and y, and colored according to factor input z (with one color for each level of z).
#' @param x x positions of points to be plotted
#' @param y y positions of points to be plotted
#' @param z a factor, the same length as x and y. Line segments in the resulting plot will be colored according to the levels of z.
#' @param color_vector a list of colors to use (length should match the number of levels in z).
