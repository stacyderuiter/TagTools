#' Read tag metadata from csv
#'
#' Read a CSV metadata file and convert it into a metadata list.
#' A metadata file is a comma-separated text file (.csv) containing a line for each metadata
#' entry. The first comma-separated field in each line is the name of the
#' entry. The last field in each line contains the value to
#' be assigned to this metadata entry. The value can be a string or number
#' but is always saved as a string in the structure - it is up to downstream
#' users of the metadata to parse/decode the entries.
#' 
#' @param fname Name of the text file to be read. If no file extension is provided, '.csv' will be
#' added automatically. If the file is not located in the current working directory, then \code{fname} must include the correct relative or absolute path.
#' @return a metadata list populated from \code{fname} (one list element per row in the file). All list elements are stored as \code{"character"} class objects (even if the field contains a number, a date, etc) - no attempt is made to determine the most appropriate class for each item.
