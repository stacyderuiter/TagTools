#' Plot an image with an irregular grid.
#'
#' This function is used to plot an image with an irregular grid. This is useful for plotting matrix data (i.e., sampled data that is a function of two parameters) in which one or both of the sampling schemes is not regularly spaced. image_irreg plots R(i,j) as a coloured patch centered on x(i), y(j) and with dimension determined by x[i] - x[i-1] and y[i] - y[i-1].
#' @param x is a vector with the horizontal axis coordinates of each value in R.
#' @param y is a vector with the vertical axis coordinates of each value in R.
#' @param R is a matrix of measurements to display. The values in R are converted to colours in the current colormap and caxis. R must be length(x) by length(y). Use NaN to have a patch not display.
