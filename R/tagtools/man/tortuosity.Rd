\title{Measure tortuosity index}
\usage{
tortuosity(T, sampling_rate, intvl)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{Contains the animal positions in a local horizontal plane. T has a row for each position and two columns: northing and easting. The positions can be in any consistent spatial unit, e.g., metres, km, nautical miles, and are referenced to an arbitrary 0,0 location. T cannot be in degrees as the distance equivalent to a degree latitude is not the same as for a degree longitude.}

\item{sampling_rate}{The sampling rate of the positions in Hertz (samples per second).}

\item{intvl}{The time interval in seconds over which tortuosity is calculated. This should be chosen according to the scale of interest, e.g., the typical length of a foraging bout.}
}
\value{
The tortuosity index which is between 0 and 1 as described above. t contains a value for each period of intvl seconds.
}
\description{
This function is used to measure the tortuosity of a regularly sampled horizontal track. Tortuosity can be measured in a number of ways. This function compares the stretched-out track length (STL) over an interval of time with the distance made good (DMG, i.e., the distance actually covered in the interval). The index returned is (STL-DMG)/STL which is 0 for straightline movement and 1 for extreme circular movement.
}
\note{
This tortuosity index is fairly insensitive to speed so if T is produced by dead-reckoning (e.g., using ptrack or htrack), the speed estimate is not important. Also the frame of T is not important as long as the two axes (nominally called northing and easting) used to describe the positions are perpendicular.
