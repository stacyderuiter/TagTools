\title{Reconstruct a track from pitch, heading and depth data, given a starting position}
\usage{

  phi,
  psi,

  q2p = 0.08,

}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A vector with depth over time (in meters, an observation)}

\item{phi}{A vector with pitch over time (in Radians, assumed as a known covariate)}

\item{psi}{A vector with heading over time (in Radians, assumed as a known covariate)}

\item{sf}{A scalar defining the sampling rate (in Hz)}

\item{r}{Observation error}

\item{q1p}{speed state error}

\item{q2p}{depth state error}

\item{q3p}{x and y state error}

\item{tagonx}{Easting of starting position (in meters, so requires projected data)}

\item{tagony}{Northing of starting position (in meters, so requires projected data)}

\item{enforce}{If TRUE (the default), then speed and depth are kept strictly positive}

\item{x}{Direct observations of Easting (in meters, so requires projected data)}

\item{y}{Direct observations of Northing (in meters, so requires projected data)}
}
\value{
A list with 10 elements:
\itemize{
 \item{\strong{p: }} the smoothed speeds
 \item{\strong{fit.ks: }} the fitted speeds
 \item{\strong{fit.kd: }} the fitted depths
 \item{\strong{fit.xs: }} the fitted xs
 \item{\strong{fit.ys: }} the fitted ys
 \item{\strong{fit.rd: }} the smoothed depths
 \item{\strong{fit.rx: }} the smoothed xs
 \item{\strong{fit.ry: }} the smoothed ys
 \item{\strong{fit.kp: }} the kalman a posteriori state covariance
 \item{\strong{fit.ksmo: }} the kalman smoother variance
}
}
\description{
The track3D function will use data from a tag to reconstruct a track by fitting a state space model using a Kalman filter. If no x,y observations are provided then this corresponds to a pseudo-track obtained via dead reckoning and extreme care is required in interpreting the results.
}
\note{
Output sampling rate is the same as the input sampling rate.

Frame: This function assumes a [north,east,up] navigation frame and a [forward,right,up] local frame. In these frames, a positive pitch angle is an anti-clockwise rotation around the y-axis. A positive roll angle is a clockwise rotation around the x-axis. A descending animal will have a negative pitch angle while an animal rolled with its right side up will have a positive roll angle.

This function output can be quite sensitive to the inputs used, namely those that define the relative weight given to the existing data, in particular regarding (x,y)=(lat,long); increasing q3p, the (x,y) state variance, will increase the weight given to independent observations of (x,y), say from GPS readings
