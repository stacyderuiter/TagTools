\title{Plot an image with an irregular grid.}
\usage{
image_irreg(x, y, R)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a vector with the horizontal axis coordinates of each value in R.}

\item{y}{is a vector with the vertical axis coordinates of each value in R.}

\item{R}{is a matrix of measurements to display. The values in R are converted to colours in the current colormap and caxis. R must be length(x) by length(y). Use NaN to have a patch not display.}
}
\description{
This function is used to plot an image with an irregular grid. This is useful for plotting matrix data (i.e., sampled data that is a function of two parameters) in which one or both of the sampling schemes is not regularly spaced. image_irreg plots R(i,j) as a coloured patch centered on x(i), y(j) and with dimension determined by x[i] - x[i-1] and y[i] - y[i-1].
