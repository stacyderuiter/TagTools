\title{Plot coloured line(s) in 3 dimensions}
\usage{
col_line3(x, y, z = 0, c, col_lab = quote(c), interactive = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector or matrix of points on the horizontal (x) axis.}

\item{y}{A vector or matrix of points on the vertical (y) axis.}

\item{z}{A vector or matrix of points on the third (z) axis.}

\item{c}{A vector or matrix of values representing the colour to draw at each point.}

\item{interactive}{logical. Plot interactive or static figure? Note: For some reason it is much faster to plot a static figure and then call ggplotly() outside this function, e.g., F <- col_line(y~x, c = z); ggplotly(F)}

\item{...}{Additional inputs for plot_ly()}

\item{c_lab}{A string to use as the label for the color legend}
}
\description{
This function is used to plot three dimensional lines with each individual line possessing a different color.
}
\note{
x, y, z and c must all be the same size vectors. The color axis will by default span the range of values in c, i.e., caxis will be c(min(min(c)), max(max(c))).
