\title{Interactive data cropping tool.}
\usage{
crop(X, sampling_rate = NULL, T = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A sensor list, vector or matrix. X can be regularly or irregularly sampled data in any frame and unit.}

\item{sampling_rate}{The sampling rate of X in Hz. This is only needed if X is not a sensor list. If X is regularly sampled, sampling_rate is one number.}

\item{T}{A vector of sampling times for X. This is only needed if X is not a sensor list and X is not regularly sampled.}
}
\value{
A list with 3 elements:
\itemize{
 \item{\strong{Y: }} A sensor list, vector or matrix containing the cropped data segment. If the input is a sensor list, the output will also be. The output has the same units, frame and sampling characteristics as the input.
 \item{\strong{T: }} A vector of sampling times for Y. This is only returned if X is irregularly sampled and X is not a sensor list. If X is a sensor list, the sampling times are stored in the list.
 \item{\strong{tcues: }} tcues is a two-element vector containing the start and end time cue in seconds of the data segment kept, i.e., tcues = c(start_time, end_time).
}
}
\description{
This function plots the input data # and allows the user to select start and end times for cropping.
}
\details{
Possible input combinations include: crop(X) if X is a sensor list, crop(X, sampling_rate) if X is a vector or matrix.

\examples{
data <- beaked_whale 
         Pc <- crop(data$P)		#interactively select a section of data
         Ydata <- list(depth = Pc$Y)
         plott(Ydata)
         #plot shows the cropped section
}
