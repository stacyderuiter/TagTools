\title{Save an item to a NetCDF or add one tag sensor or metadata variable to a NetCDF archive file.}
\usage{
add_nc(file, X, vname)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The name of the netCDF file to which to save. If the name does not include a .nc suffix, this will be added automatically.}

\item{X}{The sensor data or metadata list to be saved. a list of tag sensor and/or metadata lists. Alternatively, sensor and metadata lists may be input as multiple separate unnamed inputs. Only these kind of variables can be saved in a NetCDF file because the supporting information in these structures is needed to describe the contents of the file. For non-archive and non-portable storage of variables, consider using \code{\link{save}} or various functions to write data to text files.}

\item{vname}{The name of the sensor data stream to be saved. Defaults to the entry "name" from the sensor or metadata list provided by the user (but an option to specify a name is provided to faciliate calling this function from \code{save_nc}).}
}
\description{
Add one tag sensor or metadata variable to a NetCDF archive file. If the archive file does not exist,
it is created. The file is assumed to be in the current working directory
unless a pathname is added to the beginning of fname.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# if A is in workspace,
# add_nc('dog17_124a',A)
# generates a file dog17_124a.nc (if it does not already exist) and adds a variable A.
