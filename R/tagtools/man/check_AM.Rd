\title{Compute field intensity of tag acceleration and magnetometer data.}
\usage{
check_AM(A, M = NULL, fs = NULL, find_incl = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{An accelerometer sensor structure or matrix with columns [ax ay az]. Acceleration can be in any consistent unit, e.g., g or m/s^2.}

\item{M}{A magnetometer sensor structure or matrix, M=[mx,my,mz] in any consistent  unit (e.g., in uT or Gauss).}

\item{fs}{(optional) The sampling rate of the sensor data in Hz (samples per second). This is only needed if A and M are not sensor structures and filtering is required.}

\item{find_incl}{(optional; logical) Should inclination be computed and returned? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
If find_incl is false, then the matrix fstr is returned. Otherwise, check_AM returns a list with elements:
\itemize{
   \item{\code{fstr, }} {The estimated field intensity of A and or M in the same units as A and M.
         fstr is a vector or a two column matrix. If only one type of data is input,
         fstr will be a column vector. If both A and M are input, fstr will have two columns
         with the field strength of A in the 1st column and the field strength of M in the
         2nd column.}
   \item{\code{incl, }} {The estimated field inclination angle (i.e., the angle with respect to the
   horizontal plane) in radians. incl is a column vector. By convention, a field
   vector pointing below the horizon has a positive inclination angle. This is only
   returned if the function is called with both A and M data.}
}
}
\description{
Compute field intensity of acceleration and magnetometer data,
 and the inclination angle of the magnetic field.
 This is useful for checking the quality of a calibration,
 for detecting drift, and for validating the mapping
 of the sensor axes to the tag axes.
}
\details{
The sampling rate of fstr and incl is the same as the input sampling rate.
This function automatically low-pass filters the data with a cut-off frequency
 of 5 Hz if the sampling rate is greater than 10 Hz.
 Frame: This function assumes a [north,east,up] navigation frame and a
 [forward,right,up] local frame.

\examples{
\dontrun{
AMcheck <- check_AM(
  A = matrix(c(-0.3, 0.52, 0.8), nrow = 1),
  M = matrix(c(22, -22, 14), nrow = 1),
  fs = 1
)
# returns AMcheck$fstr = 1.0002, 34.11744 and AMcheck$incl = 0.20181 radians
