\title{Remove NAs from sensor data and return indices of (rows of) filled values}
\usage{
interp_nan(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data vector or matrix}
}
\value{
A list with entries \code{data} (the input data with NAs filled in) and \code{k} a logical vector indicating the position (if data was a vector) or rows (if data was a matrix) where NAs were filled in. Internal NAs are filled via linear interoplation, while leading and trailing ones are filled using the first following or last preceding good value.

This is an internal function used by \code{\link{htrack}}
