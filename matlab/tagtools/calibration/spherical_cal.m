function    [Y,G] = spherical_cal(X,n,method)

%     [Y,G] = spherical_cal(X)

%		or
%     [Y,G] = spherical_cal(X,n,method)
%		Deduce the calibration constants for a triaxial field sensor,
%		such as an accelerometer or magnetometer, based on movement data.
%		This can be used to do a 'bench' calibration of a sensor.
%
%		Inputs:
%     X is the segment of triaxial sensor data to calibrate. It must
%		 be a 3-column matrix. X can come from any triaxial field sensor
%		 and can be in any unit and any frame.
%     n is the target field magnitude e.g., 9.81 for accelerometer 
%      data using m/s2 as the unit.
%     method is an optional string selecting the type of calibration.
%		 The default is to calibrate for offset and scaling only. Other
%		 options are:
%      'gain' adjust gain of axes 2 and 3 relative to 1.
%      'cross' adjust gain and remove cross-axis correlations
%
%		Results:
%     Y is the matrix of converted sensor values. These will have the same
%		 units as for input argument n. The size of Y is the same as the size
%		 of X and it has the same frame and sampling rate.
%     G is the calibration structure containing fields:
%		G.poly is a matrix of polynomials. The first column of G.poly is the 
%		 three scale factors applied to the columns of X. The second column 
%		 is the offset added to each column of X after scaling.
%		G.cross is a 3x3 matrix of cross-factors. If there are no cross-terms, this
%		 is the identity matrix. Off-axis terms correct for cross-axis sensitivity.
%
%		The function reports the residual and the axial balance of the data.
%		A low residual e.g., <5% indicates that the data can be calibrated
%		well and there is not much noise. The axial balance indicates whether
%		the movement in X is suitable for data-driven calibration. If the
%		movement covers all directions fairly equally, the axial balance will
%		be high. A balance <20% may lead to unreliable calibration. For bench
%		calibrations, a high axial balance is achieved by rotating the sensor
%		through the full 3-dimensions.
%		Sampling rate and frame of Y are the same as the input data so Y
%		has the same size as X. The units of Y are the same as the units used for n. 
%		If n is not specified, the units of Y are the same as for the input data.
%		It is a good idea to low-pass filter and/or remove outliers from
%		the sensor data before using this function to reduce errors from 
%		specific acceleration and sensor noise. 
%		Notes: this function uses a Simplex search for optimal calibration parameters
%		and so can be slow if the data size is large. For this reason it is most
%		suitable for bench calibrations rather than field data.
%		This function is only usable for field sensors. It will not work
%		for gyroscope data.

%		Example:
%		 TBD.
