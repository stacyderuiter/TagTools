function    [p,pc] = fix_pressure(p,t,fs,maxp)

%     [p,pc] = fix_pressure(p,t,maxp)		% p and t are sensor structures
%		or
%     [p,pc] = fix_pressure(p,t,fs,maxp)		% p and t are vectors
%
%     Correct a depth or altitude profile for offsets caused by
%     mis-calibration and temperature. This function finds minima
%     in the dive/altitude profile that are consistent with
%     surfacing/landing. It uses the depth/height at these points
%     to fit a temperature regression.
%
%     Inputs:
%     p is a sensor structure or vector of depth/altitude in meters.
%     t is a sensor structure or vector of temperature in degrees Celsius.
%     fs is the sampling rate of p and t in Hz. This is only needed if
%		 p and t are not sensor strucures. The depth and temperature
%      must both have the same sampling rate (use decdc.m or resample.m 
%		 if needed to achieve this).
%     maxp is the maximum depth or altitude reading in the pressure data
%		 for which the animal could actually be at the surface. This is a
%		 rough measurement of the potential error in the pressure data. The
%		 unit is meters. Start with a small value, e.g., 2 m and re-run fix_depth
%		 with a larger value if there are still obvious temperature-related
%		 errors in the resulting depth/altitude profile.
%
%     Results:
%     p is a sensor structure or vector of corrected depth/altitude 
%		 measurements at the same sampling rate as the input data. If the
%		 input is a sensor structure, the output will also be. 
%     pc is a structure containing the pressure offset and temperature 
%		 correction coefficients. It has fields:
%		 pc.tref is the temperature reference in degrees Celsius (this will
%		  always be 20.
%		 pc.tcomp is the temperature compensation polynomial. This is used
%		  within the function to correct pressure as follows:
%       p = p+polyval(pc.tcomp,t-pc.tref) ;
%
%		This function makes a number of assumptions about the depth/altitude
%     data and about the behaviour of animals:
%     - the depth data should have few incorrect outlier (negative) values
%       that fall well beyond the surface. These can be reduced using
%       median_filter.m before calling fix_depth.
%     - the animal is assumed to be near the surface at least 2% of the
%       time. If the animal is less frequently at the surface, you may need
%       to change the value of PRCTSURF near the start of the function.
%     - potential surfacings are detected by looking for zero-crossings in
%       the vertical speed and this requires defining a threshold in vertical
%       speed that must be crossed by each zero crossing. The value used is
%       0.05 m/s but this may be too high for animals that move very slowly
%       near the surface. In which case, change MAXSPEED near the start of
%       the function.
%
%		Example:
%		 loadnc('mn12_186a_raw')
%		 [PP,pc] = fix_pressure(P,T,10);
%		 plott(P,PP)
%		 % lower plot shows the compensated pressure which is closer to 0 when
%		 % the animal is at the surface
