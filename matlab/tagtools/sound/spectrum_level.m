%
%     Spectrum level of a signal x, i.e., the amount of power per 1Hz
%		band. This replaces Matlab's deprecated psd function. The input
%		signal is divided into overlapping pieces equal in length to the
%		required Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) length. Each piece is
%		windowed and the FFT computed. The spectral power is then estimated
%		from the mean of the spectral magnitudes squared. Power is scaled
%		to account for the scale factor of the FFT and the window. The power
%		is also scaled by 10log10 of the bin width in Hz (i.e., the sampling
%		rate divided by the FFT length) to convert the per-bin powers into
%		approximate per-Hz powers. This scaling method is suitable for
%		wideband signals (i.e., with bandwidth wider than the bin width) but
%		is NOT suitable for narrow band and tonal signals.
%
%		Inputs:
%     x is a vector or matrix containing the signal(s) to be processed. 
%		 For signals with multiple channels, each channel should be in a 
%		 column of x.
%     nfft is the length of the FFT to use. Choose a power of two for
%      fastest operation.
%     fs is the sampling rate of the signals in x in Hz.
%     w is the optional window length. The default value is nfft. If w<nfft,
%      each segment of w samples is zero-padded to nfft. Use w=[] to use
%		 the default value if you want to specify nov.
%     nov is the number of samples to overlap each segment. The default
%      value is half of the window length.
%
%     Returns:
%     SL is the spectrum level at each frequency in dB RMS re root-Hz.
%      The spectrum is single-sided and extends to fs/2.
%      The reference level is 1.0 (i.e., white noise with unit variance
%      will have a spectrum level of 3-10*log10(fs). The 3dB is because
%      both the negative and positive spectra are added together so that
%      the total power in the signal is the same as the total power in 
%      the spectrum.
%     f is the vector of frequencies in Hz at which SL is calculated.
