function D = m_dist(data,fs, smoothDur, overlap, consec, cumSum, expStart, expEnd, baselineStart, baselineEnd, BL_COV)
% Calculate Mahalanobis distance for a multivariate time series.
%
% Inputs: 
%  data: A data frame or matrix with one row for each time point.  
%     Note that the Mahalanobis distance calculation should be 
%     carried out on continuous data only, so if your data contain 
%     logical, factor or character data, proceed at your own 
%     risk...errors (or at least meaningless results) will probably ensue.
%  fs: The sampling rate in Hz (data should be regularly sampled). 
%     If not specified it will be assumed to be 1 Hz.
%  smoothDur: The length, in minutes, of the window to use for calculation 
%     of "comparison" values. If not specified or zero, there 
%     will be no smoothing (a distance will be calculated for each data observation).
%  overlap: The amount of overlap, in minutes, between consecutive "comparison" 
%     windows. smooth_dur - overlap will give the time resolution of the 
%     resulting distance time series. If not specified or zero, 
%     there will be no overlap.  Overlap will also be set to zero if 
%     smoothDur is unspecified or zero.
%  consec: Logical. If consec=true, then the calculated distances are between
%     consecutive windows of duration smoothDur, sliding forward over 
%     the data set by a time step of (smoothDur-overlap) minutes.  
%     If TRUE, baselineStart and baselineEnd inputs will be used to define
%     the period used to calculate the data covariance matrix. Default is consec=false.  
%  cumSum: Logical.  If cum_sum=true, then output will be the cumulative 
%     sum of the calculated distances, rather than the distances themselves. 
%     Default is cum_sum=false.
%  expStart: Start times (in seconds since start of the data set) of the experimental exposure period(s).  
%  expEnd: End times (in seconds since start of the data set) of the experimental exposure period(s).
%     If either or both of exp_start and exp_end are missing, the distance will be
%     calculated over whole dataset and full dataset will be assumed to be baseline.
%  baselineStart: Start time (in seconds since start of the data set) of the baseline period 
%     (the mean data values for this period will be used as the 'control' to which all 
%     "comparison" data points (or windows) will be compared. if not specified, 
%     it will be assumed to be 0 (start of record).
%  baselineEnd: End time (in seconds since start of the data set) of the baseline period.  
%     If not specified, the entire data set will be used (baseline_end will 
%     be the last sampled time-point in the data set).
%       
% Outputs:
%  D: Data structure containing results
%     t: Times, in seconds since start of dataset, at which Mahalanobis distances are 
%        reported. If a smoothDur was applied, then the reported times will be the 
%        start times of each "comparison" window.
%     dist: Mahalanobis distances between the specified baseline period and 
%        the specified "comparison" periods
