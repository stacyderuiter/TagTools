function		Xa = tag2animal(X,fs,OTAB)
%
%		Xa = tag2animal(X,fs,OTAB)		% X is a matrix
%		or
%		Xa = tag2animal(X,OTAB)			% X is a sensor structure
%		or
%		Xa = tag2animal(X,Ya)			% X and Ya are sensor structures
%
%     Convert tag frame measurements to animal frame using pre-determined
%		tag orientation(s) on the animal. 
%
%		Inputs:
%		X is data from a triaxial sensor such as an accelerometer.
%		 magnetometer or a gyroscope. X can be a three column matrix or a
%		 sensor structure. In either case, X is in the tag frame, i.e., expressed
%		 in the cannonical axes of the tag, not the animal.
%		 X can have any unit and sampling rate.
%     fs is the sampling rate of X in Hz (samples per second). This is
%		 only needed if X is not a sensor structure.
%		OTAB is a matrix defining the orientation of the tag on the animal
%		 as a function of time. Each row of OTAB is:
%        [cue1 cue2 pitch roll heading]
%      where cue1 is the start time of a move in seconds with respect to the
%		 start of X. cue2 is the end time of the move. If cue1 and cue2 are the
%		 same, the move is instantaneous, otherwise a gradual move will be implemented
%		 in which the orientation of the tag is linearly interpolated between the
%		 previous and the new orientation.
%      The pitch, roll and heading angles describe the tag orientation on the
%      animal at the end of the move (angles are in radians).
%	    The first row of OTAB must have cue1 and cue2 equal to 0 as this is the initial
%		 orientation of the tag on the animal. Subsequent rows (if any) of OTAB describe
%		Ya is an optional sensor structure in which the sensor data has already been
%		 converted to the animal frame. The OTAB is extracted from this structure. This
%		 is useful, for example, to replicate tag-to-animal conversions at different
%		 sampling rates.
%
%		Output:
%		Xa is the sensor data in the animal frame, i.e., rotated to correct for the tag
%		 orientation on the animal. If X is a sensor structure, Xa will also be one. In this
%		 case the structure elements 'frame' and 'name' will be changed. The OTAB will also
%	    be added to the structure.
%
%		Example:
%		 See animaltags.org for examples of how to use this function.
