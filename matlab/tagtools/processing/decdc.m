function      [y,xx,v,h] = decdc(x,df)

%     y = decdc(x,df)
%     Reduce the sampling rate of a time series by an integer factor.
%	   This is similar to decimate() and resample() but is delay free 
%	   and DC accurate which are important for sensor data. 
%
%		Inputs:
%		x is a sensor structure or a vector or matrix containing the signal(s) 
%		 to be decimated. If x is a matrix (or the data in the sensor structure
%		 is a matrix), each column is decimated separately.
%		df is the decimation factor. The output sampling rate is the input
%		 sampling rate divided by df. df must be an integer greater than 1.
%
%		Returns:
%		y is the decimated signal vector or matrix. It has the same number
%		 of columns as x but has 1/df of the rows. If x is a sensor structure,
%		 y is also, in which case the metadata is copied except for the sampling
%		 rate which is adjusted to the new value.
%
%     Decimation is performed by first low-pass filtering x and then
%		keeping 1 sample out of every df. A symmetric FIR filter with length
%		12*df and cutoff frequency 0.4*fs/df is used. The group delay of the
%		filter is removed.
%		For large decimation factors (e.g., df>>50), it is better to perform
%		several decimations with lower factors. For example to decimate by 120,
%		use: decdc(decdc(x,10),12).
%
%		Example:
% 		s=sin(2*pi/100*(0:1000-1)');		% sine wave at full sampling rate
% 		s4=sin(2*pi*4/100*(0:250-1)');	% same sine wave at 1/4 of the sampling rate
% 		ds=decdc(s,4);							% decimate the full rate sine wave
%		plot([s4 ds])
%		max(abs(s4-ds))
%		Returns: 0.0023
% 		i.e., there is almost no difference between s4 and ds.
