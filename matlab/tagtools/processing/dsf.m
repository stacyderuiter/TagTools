%
%		Estimate the dominant stroke frequency from accelerometer or
%     magnetometer data. Animals tend to produce propulsive movements 
%     with a narrow frequency range. These movements cause cyclical 
%     changes in posture and/or specific acceleration. Posture changes are
%     measured by an animal-attached magnetometer while both posture changes
%     and specific acceleration are measured by an accelerometer. Thus 
%     sections of magnetometer or accelerometer data that largely contain 
%     propulsion should show a spectral peak in one or more axes at the 
%     dominant stroke frequency.
%
%		Inputs:
%     X is a sensor structure or 3 column magnetometer or acceleration matrix.
%      Data can be in any unit and frame. 
%     fs is the sampling rate of the sensor data in Hz (samples per second). This
%      is only required if X is not a sensor structure.
%	   fc (optional) specifies the cut-off frequency in Hz of a low-pass filter
%		 to apply to X before computing the spectra. This prevents high frequency
%		 transients e.g., in foraging, from dominating the spectra. The filter 
%		 length is 6*fs/fc. If fc is not specified, it defaults to 5 Hz.
%		 If fc>fs/2, the filtering operation is skipped.
%		Nfft (optional) specifies the FFT length and therefore the frequency
%		 resolution. The default value is the power of two closest to 20*fs, i.e.,
%		 an analysis block length of about 20 s and a frequency resolution of about
%		 0.05 Hz. A shorter FFT may be required if movement behaviour is very variable.
%		 A longer FFT may work well if propulsion is continuous and stereotyped.
%
%     Returns:
%		fpk is the dominant stroke frequency (i.e., the peak frequency in the
%		 sum of the power spectrum for each axis) in Hz. Quadratic interpolation is used
%		 over the spectral peak to improve resolution.
%		q is the quality of the peak measured by the peak power divided by the mean
%		 power of the spectra. This is a dimensionless number which is large if there
%		 is a clear spectral peak.
%
%		Frame: This function makes no assumption about measurement frame. Data in
%		any frame can be used.
%		Data selection: This function works best if the data covers an interval in 
%     which propulsion is the main activity. This could be a complete
%		dive or an interval of running or flapping flight. The interval length should 
%		be at least Nfft/fs seconds, i.e., 20 s for the default FFT length. 
%
%		Example:
%        TBD
