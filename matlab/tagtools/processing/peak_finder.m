function peaks = peak_finder(x,fs,thresh,blank,doplot)

%   peaks = peak_finder(X,thresh,blank,doplot)  % X is a sensor structure
%   or
%   peaks = peak_finder(X,fs,thresh,blank,doplot)  % x is a vector
%   This function detects peaks in a signal that exceed a specified 
%   threshold and returns each peak's start time, end time, maximum jerk
%   value, time of the maximum jerk, threshold level, and blanking time.
%
% INPUTS:
%   X   A sensor structure or vector containing data to be used 
%       in peak detection. If X has more than one column of data,
%       only the first column will be analysed.
%   fs  The sampling rate in Hz of the signal in x. This is only
%       required if X is not a sensor structure.
%   thresh  The threshold level above which peaks in x are detected. 
%       Input must be in the same units as x. If thresh is missing/empty,
%       the default level is the 99 percentile of x.
%   blank   The minimum time between detections in seconds. If blank is
%       missing/empty the default value for the blanking time is 1/10th of
%       the duration of signal x.
%   doplot Enable interactive plotting if doplot=1 or is missing or empty, 
%       allowing the user to manipulate the thresh and blank values and  
%       observe the changes in peak detection. Look at the command window  
%       for help on how to use the plot. If doplot is 0, no plot
%       is generated. 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   peaks = A structure containing vectors for the start times, end times,
%       peak times, peak maxima, thresh, and blanking time. All times are in seconds.
