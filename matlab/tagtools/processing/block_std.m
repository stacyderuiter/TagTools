function    [Y,t] = block_std(X,n,nov)

%     [Y,t] = block_std(X,n,nov)
%	   Compute the standard deviation of successive blocks of samples.
%		
%		Inputs: 
%		X is a vector or a matrix containing samples of a signal in each column.
%		n is the number of samples from X to use in each analysis block.
% 	   nov is the number of samples that the next block overlaps the previous block.
%
%		Returns:
%		Y is a vector or matrix containing the standard deviation of each block. 
%     If X is a mxn matrix, Y is pxn where p is the number of complete n-length 
%     blocks with nov that can be made out of m samples, 
%     i.e., n+(p-1)*(n-nov) < m
%
%		Example:
%		 TBD

%     Valid: Matlab, Octave
