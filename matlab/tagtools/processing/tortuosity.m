function    t = tortuosity(T,fs,intvl)

%    t = tortuosity(T,fs,intvl)
%    Measure tortuousity index of a regularly sampled horizontal track.
%    Tortuosity can be measured in a number of ways. This function
%    compares the stretched-out track length (STL) over an interval of
%    time with the distance made good (DMG, i.e., the distance actually
%    covered in the interval). The index returned is (STL-DMG)/STL which
%    is 0 for straightline movement and 1 for extreme circular movement.
%
%    Inputs:
%    T contains the animal positions in a local horizontal plane. T has a row
%     for each position and two columns: northing and easting. The
%     positions can be in any consistent spatial unit, e.g., metres, km,
%     nautical miles, and are referenced to an arbitrary 0,0 location. 
%     T cannot be in degrees as the distance equivalent to a degree latitude 
%     is not the same as for a degree longitude.
%    fs is the sampling rate of the positions in Hertz (samples per
%     second).
%    intvl is the time interval in seconds over which tortuosity is
%     calculated. This should be chosen according to the scale of interest,
%     e.g., the typical length of a foraging bout.
%
%    Returns:
%    t is the tortuosity index which is between 0 and 1 as described
%     above. t contains a value for each period of intvl seconds.
%
%    This tortuosity index is fairly insensitive to speed so if T is 
%    produced by dead-reckoning (e.g., using ptrack or htrack), the speed
%    estimate is not important. Also the frame of T is not important as
%    long as the two axes (nominally called northing and easting) used to
%    describe the positions are perpendicular.
%
%	  Example:
%		t = tortuosity(T,fs,90)
% 	   returns: .
