function    [RI,t] = residence_index(T,fs,maxt,r,tstep)

%     [RI,t]=residence_index(T,fs,maxt)
%     or

%     or
%     [RI,t]=residence_index(T,fs,maxt,r,tstep)
%
%     Compute the residence index (RI) of a regularly sampled track.
%     RI is a measure of the track tortuosity which is similar to Area
%     Restricted Search and Time of First Passage. This function follows
%     the definition of RI in Johnson et al. Proc Royal Soc. 2008 275:133-139
%     which differs a little from other definitions. RI is the amount of time
%     that the animal is within a sphere of radius r meters divided by r. The
%     units are therefore time/meter. A large RI implies that the track
%     is circling and effectively staying in the same area. A low RI implies
%		a progressing track with few course changes. The track can be
%		two dimensional (i.e., horizontal information only) or three dimensional.
%		If no depth or altitude information is given, the depth is assumed to be 
%		zero and the RI measures the time that the track is within a circle of
%		radius r.
%
%		Inputs:
%	   T is the estimated track in a local level frame. T must have two or three
%		 columns. The first two columns are the horizontal locations usually described
%		 in terms of the northward and eastward position (termed 'northing' 
%      and 'easting', i.e, T=[northing,easting]). If T has three columns, the third
%		 column is the depth or altitude of each track point. However, any perpendicular
%      set of 2 or 3 axes will work. The track must be in meters.
%     fs is the sampling rate of the track in Hz (samples per second).
%		maxt is the maximum time in seconds that the track is analysed before
%		 and after each track point. This should be larger than the expected maximum
%		 time that the track could be within the sphere.
%     r is the optional radius of the sphere in meters. Default value is 20 m.
%     tstep is the optional time step of the analysis in seconds. Default value
%      is 5 s.
%
%     Returns:
%     RI is a vector of residence indices.
%     t is a vector giving the time in seconds of each sample of RI with respect
%      to the start time of the track.
