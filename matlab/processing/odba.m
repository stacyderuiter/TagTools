%       Compute the 'Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration' sensu Wilson et al. 2006.
%       ODBA is the norm of the high-pass-filtered acceleration. Several methods
%		  for computing ODBA are in use which differ by which norm and which filter
%		  are used. In the Wilson paper, the 1-norm and a rectangular window (moving
%		  average) filter are used. The moving average is subtracted from the input
%		  accelerations to implement a high-pass filter. The 2-norm may be preferable 
%		  if the tag orientation is unknown or may change and this is termed VeDBA. 
%		  A tapered symmetric FIR filter gives more efficient high-pass filtering 
%		  compared to the rectangular window method and avoids lobes in the response.
%
%		  Inputs:
%       A is a sensor structure or a 3 column acceleration matrix with columns 
%        [ax ay az]. Acceleration can be in any consistent unit, e.g., g or m/s^2. 
%        A can be in any frame but the result depends on the method used to compute 
%        ODBA. The default method and VeDBA method are rotation independent and so 
%        give the same result irrespective of the frame of A. The 1-norm method has 
%        a more complex dependency on frame.
%       fs is the sampling rate in Hz of the acceleration signals. This is only
%        required if A is a matrix and if FIR filtering is used (i.e., if you are also
%        giving a fh argument).
%       fh is the high-pass filter cut-off frequency in Hz. This should be chosen
%		   to be about half of the stroking rate for the animal (e.g., using dsf.m).
%			fh is only needed if using the default (FIR filtering) method.
%		  n is the rectangular window (moving average) length in samples. This is only
%		   needed if using the classic ODBA and VeDBA forms.
%		  method is a string containing either 'wilson' or 'vedba'. If the third argument
%		   to odba.m is a string, either the classic 1-norm ODBA ('wilson') or the 2-norm 
%		   VeDBA ('vedba') is computed, in either case with an n-length rectangular window.
%
%		  Result:
%       e is a column vector of ODBA with the same number of rows as A. e has the same
%		   units as A.
%
%		  Example:
%		   odba([1,-0.5,0.1;0.8,-0.2,0.6;0.5,-0.9,-0.7],5,'vedba')
%		   returns: [0.68475;0.93393;0.83600;0.65744]
