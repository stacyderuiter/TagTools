You should have the standard sets of toolboxes to be able to use our package, however, which may incur additional costs. For more information about Matlab or to purchase it, see [MathWorks.com](https://www.mathworks.com/). Octave, by contrast, is free and open-source. You'll want the newest version (at least 6.2.0). For an easy install on Mac, see [octave-app.org](https://octave-app.org/). For Windows, other operating systems, and to \n",

    "This practical assumes that you have some basic experience working with this software, and can execute provided code. If you happen to be new to Matlab, the included Matlab Onramp is very good. For Octave, here are a couple of YouTube videos: [basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOs4eqoXPPA) and [slightly more advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGqwF2s-tM). \n",
