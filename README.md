# TagTools - We've Moved!

This personal repository is no longer maintained -- the animaltags tools have moved to <https://github.com/animaltags/tagtools_r>. Please update your code and bookmarks!

The package still provides software tools for high-resolution movement data from bio-logging tags. A Matlab/Octave version and a partially-completed Python version are also available - see <https://github.com/animaltags>.
